A sample of programming and code I've created for various projects

"Google Maps" - PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, Google Maps API v3. A project to integrate an interactive, dynamic map on a PHP/MySQL website for a farmers' market association with over 65 unique markets. Through PHP a MySQL database is queried, and echo array created in JavaScript that populates interactive markers and corresponding information including Market Name, Location, Hours, Season, Directions, and Social Media Link. A working, interactive example of the resulting map, is on my website. I simulated a date of March 28th to show open vs closed markets, and links have been replaced with dummy placeholders for example purposes. See it at: http://jpost-design.com/#interactive-map
